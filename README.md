# Melvix

![Melvix Demo](screenshots/Home.png)

Melvix is a special project created as a birthday gift for my boyfriend, Melvin. It is a Flutter app inspired by the design of Netflix, hence the name "Melvix" (a combination of "Melvin" and "Netflix"). The app showcases a collection of personal videos featuring Melvin and me. Please note that this project is purely for fun and is not intended to be a clean, properly tested software solution.

## Features

- Netflix-inspired design: The app replicates the user interface of Netflix, providing a familiar and intuitive experience.
- TikTok-inspired "For You" page: Melvix features a "For You" page where memories are displayed in a TikTok-like vertical scrolling format, allowing for a fun and engaging browsing experience.
- Video upload functionality: The app includes an upload function that enables the addition of new videos to the "For You" page, providing the opportunity to expand the collection with more cherished memories.
- Firebase hosting: The videos are hosted on Firebase, allowing for easy access and seamless playback.
